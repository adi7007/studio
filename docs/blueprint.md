# **App Name**: Sentinel Tracker

## Core Features:

- System Activity Logger: Tracks all system movements (e.g. application usage, file access) and logs them with timestamps.
- Sleep/Shutdown Detection: Detects system sleep/shutdown events and the subsequent login.
- Work State Prompt: Presents a question to the user upon login after a sleep/shutdown event: 'Where were you in your work when you left the system?' This uses a tool to determine the best time to ask this.
- Contextual Note Capture: Saves user responses about their work context at the time of logout or system idle, tagged by timestamp.
- Timeline Visualization: Displays the logged data and user responses in a chronological timeline view, allowing users to review their activities and notes.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Midnight blue (#2C3E50) to evoke professionalism and seriousness, necessary for a tracking application.
- Background color: Very light grey (#F0F2F5), providing a clean, neutral backdrop that doesn't distract from the data.
- Accent color: Subtle teal (#3498DB) for interactive elements and highlights, offering a touch of vibrancy without overwhelming the interface.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif chosen for its modern, neutral look.
- Use minimalist icons for system events and actions, ensuring clarity and ease of understanding.
- Emphasize a clean and organized layout, prioritizing data clarity and ease of navigation.
- Subtle transitions for timeline events and prompts, enhancing user experience without being distracting.
